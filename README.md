# Favorite Movies Website
### (Fresh Tomatoes)

This website uses back end functionality to store my favorite movies and display them on a webpage. It simply utilizes a class of movie in the module media to create each entry. All data is supplied from "The Movie Data Base" API. An API key will be needed to access TMDB data.

### Getting Started

First you must acquire an API key from The Movie Data Base. You can follow the tutorial here in the API documentation:
https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction

To add the generated API key, go to ```tmdb_api.py```, and assign the key to the "API_KEY" variable.

To generate the HTML page for Fresh Tomatoes, all you need to do is download the project repository and run the following command in the repository directory.

```
python entertainment_center.py
```

This will execute the program, generate the html page in the repository directory, and open it in a browser window.
